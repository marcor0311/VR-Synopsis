## Agora SDK 4: Streamlined Real-Time Communication

### Overview
Agora SDK 4 is a versatile toolkit for seamless real-time audio and video communication across different spaces.

### Usage
Used in this project for webcam (audio and video) communication.

### Examples

- [Explanatory Video about the Development Environment necessary for Agora SDK 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMhcinIOpHk)

### Recommendations
Start with [Agora for 2D Spaces](https://github.com/marcor0311/unity-agora-sdk-4-with-ui-for-2d-spaces) before progressing to [Agora for 3D Spaces](https://github.com/marcor0311/unity-agora-sdk-4-for-3d-spaces) for a comprehensive understanding.

Possible approaches that could be helpful are located in Assets/Agora-Unity-RTC-Plugin/API-Example/Examples/Advanced. One that has a lot of potential to solve the problem is ***Screen Share***.

## Render Texture Approach

### Concept
The **render texture approach** in Unity involves capturing the output of a rendering process and using it as a texture.

### Usage
The render texture approach is used in this project for real-time rendering of the virtual camera.

### Tutorial
Explore a video introduction in my youtube tutorial:

- [Explanatory Video about how to create a Render Texture for a Virtual Camera in Unity](https://youtu.be/HTvgcDDtNkM)

## Cinemachine

### Overview
Cinemachine is a Unity asset designed to simplify the process of creating and managing complex camera systems for virtual experiences. You can download directly from Unity in the Package Manager in the section Unity Registry and search for Cinemachine.

### Usage
Used in this project to manage the multiple cameras of the users (also called players in the tutorial of Photon).
