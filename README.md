### Recommendations
Start with [Agora for 2D Spaces](https://github.com/marcor0311/unity-agora-sdk-4-with-ui-for-2d-spaces) before progressing to [Agora for 3D Spaces](https://github.com/marcor0311/unity-agora-sdk-4-for-3d-spaces) for a comprehensive understanding.

Possible approaches that could be helpful are located in Assets/Agora-Unity-RTC-Plugin/API-Example/Examples/Advanced. One that has a lot of potential to solve the problem is ***Screen Share***.

## Render Texture Approach

### Concept
The **render texture approach** in Unity involves capturing the output of a rendering process and using it as a texture.

### Usage
The render texture approach is used in this project for real-time rendering of the virtual camera.
